- 👋 Hi, I’m @LDec-AlmostHuman
- 👀 I’m interested in AI/ML/DL and ROS2.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on porting robot from ROS Melodic to Noetic and even futher to ROS2 Foxy & Humble (here are more troubles :) ).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects related to ROS2.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Hmm, not sure how GitHub is working yet, so I will post info about it later.
